# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added

- Convert inline markdown links in text (e.g., `[text](url)`) into clickable hyperlinks inside paragraphs and list items.

### Notes

- This change extends `processFormattedText` to emit `ExternalHyperlink` nodes alongside `TextRun`, enabling mixed inline links within content.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-09-05

### Added

- New exported function `parseToDocxOptions(markdown, options)` that generates the `docx` `Document` configuration without creating a Blob. Useful for advanced pipelines, custom transforms, and testing.

### Changed

- Refactored `convertMarkdownToDocx` to delegate configuration generation to `parseToDocxOptions`, improving separation of concerns and testability. No breaking changes to the existing API.

### Fixed

- Images now preserve aspect ratio instead of being forced square; honors size hints in the image URL fragment such as `#180x16`, `#w=150&h=100`, and `#width=..&height=..`. Also supports data URLs directly. (Addresses issue #11)

### Tests

- Expanded image test in `tests/index.test.ts` to include explicit width/height hints.
- Added `tests/image-size.test.ts` to validate width-only, width+height, and data URL scenarios for images.

## [2.2.1] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed

- Unified table separator detection in `src/index.ts` to support alignment markers (`:---`, `:---:`, `---:`) in Markdown tables, matching `collectTables` behavior.

### Added

- New tests for table rendering covering alignment markers and empty cells.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-08-08

### Added

- Inline link support inside paragraphs (e.g., mixed text with `[text](url)`)
- Strikethrough formatting with `~~text~~` for headings and paragraphs

### Fixed

- ESM export path in `src/index.ts` to ensure Node ESM consumers resolve `./types.js`
- Image handling works in both Node and browsers; infers image type from headers/URL and uses `Uint8Array` in browsers
- Table parsing preserves empty cells (no column collapse)
- Enforced input validation in `convertMarkdownToDocx` for safer API usage
- Reduced noisy console logs in library code

### Removed

- Deleted dead root-level `index.ts` that referenced undefined variables

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-08

### Added

- RTL/LTR direction support via new `style.direction` option (`"LTR" | "RTL"`).
  - Applies bidirectional layout to paragraphs, headings, blockquotes, list items, TOC entries, links, inline code, and code blocks (uses paragraph `bidirectional` and text run `rightToLeft` where appropriate in `docx`).
  - Works well in combination with `paragraphAlignment: "RIGHT"` for typical RTL layouts.

### Notes

- Direction is applied at paragraph and run level; style-level paragraph style does not include `bidirectional` per `docx` typings, so it is set on individual elements.

## [2.0.3] - 2025-01-21
